# LADXRandomizer

An attempt at creating a chest randomizer for The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX. By now, there already exists a randomizer for Link's Awakening. It actually seems likely to have begun development before or around the same time as I did. Regardless, this project is obsolete.

This project fell to the wayside due to my classes at University taking priority. So, ultimately, this was more an early exercise in reading and writing to binary files.
